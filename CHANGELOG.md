Great submission and nice implmentation of IPFS. **Contract Review:** Your contract was similar to the course contract so I optimized the contract code, added a Sale functionality to record all sales details (Game ID, Buyer, Seller, Amount and Timestamp) then made the ability to get sales restricted and accessible by the contract admin. **DApp Review:** Lots of the packages used was displaying 'NPM Deprecated Error' at the installation phase but after a while I got thing set locally. **Design Review:**
